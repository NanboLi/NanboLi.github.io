I obtained my PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 2022, under the supervision of [*Prof. Robert Fisher*](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/) (principal) and [*Prof. Chris Williams*](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/) (second). Prior to this, I acquired an BEng with honours (Outstanding Engineer) from Wuhan University of Technology, and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence with honours (Distinction) from the University of Edinburgh.


Research
------
My research interests lie in machine learning, causality, and computer vision, particularly *generative models* and *causal representation learning*. My PhD research focused on developing machine learning models that could disentangle spurious correlations within data, enabling the identification of modular generative structures for interventional reasoning. As my research closely connects to multiple well-established AI/ML/CV topics like *world models*, *uncertainty estimation*, and *visual scene understanding/modelling*, I am also excited about researching fundamental problems in these areas and their broad applications in healthcare, finance, and physics. 

<!-- My research interests lie in generative models and causal representation learning. In particular, during my PhD studies, I focused on structured representation learning using generative models. This involves investigating methods to disentangle spurious correlations and identify modular structures within data to facilitate interventional reasoning. In general, I am passionate about building (structured) world models, advancing science (esp. healthcare, physics, and finance) with AI, and dreaming about creating artificial general intelligence (AGI). -->
