I obtained my PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 2022, under the supervision of [*Prof. Robert Fisher*](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/) (principal) and [*Prof. Chris Williams*](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/) (second). Prior to this, I acquired an BEng with honours (Outstanding Engineer) from Wuhan University of Technology, and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence with honours (Distinction) from the University of Edinburgh.


Research
------
My research interests lie in generative models and causal representation learning. In particular, during my PhD studies, I focused on structured representation learning using generative models. This involves investigating methods to disentangle spurious correlations within data to identify modular structures that could facilitate interventions. In general, I am passionate about building (structured) world models, advancing science with AI, and dreaming about creating artificial general intelligence (AGI).
