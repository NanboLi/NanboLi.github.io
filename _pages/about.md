I am a Post-doctoral Fellow with [Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) at the *KAUST Center of Excellence For Generative AI*. I obtained my PhD from the *University of Edinburgh*, under the supervision of [Prof. Robert Fisher](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/) and [Prof. Chris Williams](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/). I am working on machine learning, with a particular focus on world models.


<!-- Research
------
My research interests lie in machine learning, causality, and computer vision, particularly *generative models* and *causal representation learning*. During my PhD studies, I developed machine learning models capable of disentangling spurious correlations within data, allowing for the identification of modular generative structures for counterfactual reasoning. As my research closely connects to multiple well-established AI/ML/CV topics like *world models*, *uncertainty estimation*, and *visual scene understanding/modelling*, I am also enthusiastic about researching fundamental problems in these areas and their widespread applications in healthcare, finance, and physics. In summary, I am passionate about building models that can reason about "why", advancing science with AI, and envisioning the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).  -->
